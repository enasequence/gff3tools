SO:0000386 	RNase_P_RNA	The RNA component of Ribonuclease P (RNase P), a ubiquitous endoribonuclease, found in archaea, bacteria and eukarya as well as chloroplasts and mitochondria. Its best characterized activity is the generation of mature 5 prime ends of tRNAs by cleaving the 5 prime leader elements of precursor-tRNAs. Cellular RNase Ps are ribonucleoproteins. RNA from bacterial RNase Ps retains its catalytic activity in the absence of the protein subunit, i.e. it is a ribozyme. Isolated eukaryotic and archaeal RNase P RNA has not been shown to retain its catalytic function, but is still essential for the catalytic activity of the holoenzyme. Although the archaeal and eukaryotic holoenzymes have a much greater protein content than the bacterial ones, the RNA cores from all the three lineages are homologous. Helices corresponding to P1, P2, P3, P4, and P10/11 are common to all cellular RNase P RNAs. Yet, there is considerable sequence variation, particularly among the eukaryotic RNAs.	ncRNA	/ncRNA_class="RNase_P_RNA"
SO:0000385 	RNase_MRP_RNA	The RNA molecule essential for the catalytic activity of RNase MRP, an enzymatically active ribonucleoprotein with two distinct roles in eukaryotes.

SO:0000646 	siRNA	A small RNA molecule that is the product of a longer exogenous or endogenous dsRNA, which is either a bimolecular duplex or very long hairpin, processed (via the Dicer pathway) such that numerous siRNAs accumulate from both strands of the dsRNA. SRNAs trigger the cleavage of their target molecules.	ncRNA	/ncRNA_class="siRNA"

Micro RNAs are produced from precursor molecules (SO:0000647) that can form local hairpin structures, which ordinarily are processed (usually via the Dicer pathway) such that a single miRNA molecule accumulates from one arm of a hairpin precursor molecule. Micro RNAs may trigger the cleavage of their target molecules or act as translational repressors.	ncRNA	/ncRNA_class="miRNA"
SO:0001035	piRNA	Asmall non coding RNA, part of a silencing system that prevents the spreading of selfish genetic elements.	ncRNA	/ncRNA_class="piRNA"
SO:0000275 	snoRNA	A snoRNA (small nucleolar RNA) is any one of a class of small RNAs that are associated with the eukaryotic nucleus as components of small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins. They participate in the processing or modifications of many RNAs, mostly ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) though snoRNAs are also known to target other classes of RNA, including spliceosomal RNAs, tRNAs, and mRNAs via a stretch of sequence that is complementary to a sequence in the targeted RNA.	ncRNA	/ncRNA_class="snoRNA"
SO:0000593 	C_D_box_snoRNA	Most box C/D snoRNAs also contain long (>10 nt) sequences complementary to rRNA. Boxes C and D, as well as boxes C' and D', are usually located in close proximity, and form a structure known as the box C/D motif. This motif is important for snoRNA stability, processing, nucleolar targeting and function. A small number of box C/D snoRNAs are involved in rRNA processing; most, however, are known or predicted to serve as guide RNAs in ribose methylation of rRNA. Targeting involves direct base pairing of the snoRNA at the rRNA site to be modified and selection of a rRNA nucleotide a fixed distance from box D or D'.	ncRNA	/ncRNA_class="snoRNA"	/note="C_D_box_snoRNA"
SO:0000403 	U14_snoRNA	U14 small nucleolar RNA (U14 snoRNA) is required for early cleavages of eukaryotic precursor rRNAs.

SO:0000391 	U1_snRNA	U1 is a small nuclear RNA (snRNA) component of the spliceosome (involved in pre-mRNA splicing). Its 5' end forms complementary base pairs with the 5' splice junction, thus defining the 5' donor site of an intron. There are significant differences in sequence and secondary structure between metazoan and yeast U1 snRNAs, the latter being much longer (568 nucleotides as compared to 164 nucleotides in human). Nevertheless, secondary structure predictions suggest that all U1 snRNAs share a 'common core' consisting of helices I, II, the proximal region of III, and IV.	ncRNA	/ncRNA_class="snRNA"	/note="U1_snRNA"
SO:0000392 	U2_snRNA	U2 is a small nuclear RNA (snRNA) component of the spliceosome (involved in pre-mRNA splicing). Complementary binding between U2 snRNA (in an area lying towards the 5' end but 3' to hairpin I) and the branchpoint sequence (BPS) of the intron results in the bulging out of an unpaired adenine, on the BPS, which initiates a nucleophilic attack at the intronic 5' splice site, thus starting the first of two transesterification reactions that mediate splicing.	ncRNA	/ncRNA_class="snRNA"	/note="U2_snRNA"
SO:0000393 	U4_snRNA	U4 small nuclear RNA (U4 snRNA) is a component of the major U2-dependent spliceosome. It forms a duplex with U6, and with each splicing round, it is displaced from U6 (and the spliceosome) in an ATP-dependent manner, allowing U6 to refold and create the active site for splicing catalysis. A recycling process involving protein Prp24 re-anneals U4 and U6.	ncRNA	/ncRNA_class="snRNA"	/note="U4_snRNA"
SO:0000394 	U4atac_snRNA	An snRNA required for the splicing of the minor U12-dependent class of eukaryotic nuclear introns. It forms a base paired complex with U6atac_snRNA (SO:0000397).	ncRNA	/ncRNA_class="snRNA"	/note="U4atac_snRNA"
SO:0000395 	U5_snRNA	U5 RNA is a component of both types of known spliceosome. The precise function of this molecule is unknown, though it is known that the 5' loop is required for splice site selection and p220 binding, and that both the 3' stem-loop and the Sm site are important for Sm protein binding and cap methylation.	ncRNA	/ncRNA_class="snRNA"	/note="U5_snRNA"
SO:0000396 	U6_snRNA	U6 snRNA is a component of the spliceosome which is involved in splicing pre-mRNA. The putative secondary structure consensus base pairing is confined to a short 5' stem loop, but U6 snRNA is thought to form extensive base-pair interactions with U4 snRNA.	ncRNA	/ncRNA_class="snRNA"	/note="U6_snRNA"
SO:0000397 	U6atac_snRNA	U6atac_snRNA is an snRNA required for the splicing of the minor U12-dependent class of eukaryotic nuclear introns. It forms a base paired complex with U4atac_snRNA (SO:0000394).	ncRNA	/ncRNA_class="snRNA"	/note="U6atac_snRNA"

SO:0000399 	U12_snRNA	The U12 small nuclear (snRNA), together with U4atac/U6atac, U5, and U11 snRNAs and associated proteins, forms a spliceosome that cleaves a divergent class of low-abundance pre-mRNA introns.	ncRNA	/ncRNA_class="snRNA"	/note="U12_snRNA"
SO:0000590 	SRP_RNA	The signal recognition particle (SRP) is a universally conserved ribonucleoprotein. It is involved in the co-translational targeting of proteins to membranes. The eukaryotic SRP consists of a 300-nucleotide 7S RNA and six proteins: SRPs 72, 68, 54, 19, 14, and 9. Archaeal SRP consists of a 7S RNA and homologues of the eukaryotic SRP19 and SRP54 proteins. In most eubacteria, the SRP consists of a 4.5S RNA and the Ffh protein (a homologue of the eukaryotic SRP54 protein). Eukaryotic and archaeal 7S RNAs have very similar secondary structures, with eight helical elements. These fold into the Alu and S domains, separated by a long linker region. Eubacterial SRP is generally a simpler structure, with the M domain of Ffh bound to a region of the 4.5S RNA that corresponds to helix 8 of the eukaryotic and archaeal SRP S domain. Some Gram-positive bacteria (e.g. Bacillus subtilis), however, have a larger SRP RNA that also has an Alu domain. The Alu domain is thought to mediate the peptide chain elongation retardation function of the SRP. The universally conserved helix which interacts with the SRP54/Ffh M domain mediates signal sequence recognition. In eukaryotes and archaea, the SRP19-helix 6 complex is thought to be involved in SRP assembly and stabilizes helix 8 for SRP54 binding.	ncRNA	/ncRNA_class="SRP_RNA"
SO:0000404 	vault_RNA	A family of RNAs are found as part of the enigmatic vault ribonucleoprotein complex.
